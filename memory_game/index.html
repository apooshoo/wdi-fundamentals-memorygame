	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
	<h2>Beat your friends</h2>
	<p>Did you know that good memory is a sign of high IQ? No? Great, because I made up that fact five seconds ago. But that doesn't matter. Win. Look smart. Establish dominance. You'll thank me later.</p>
